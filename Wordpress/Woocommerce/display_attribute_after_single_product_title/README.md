# display_attribute_after_single_product_title
Creates a function to display the custom attribute Author below the product title in single product view for WooCommerce, Wordpress.

I don't know if this is the best way to approach this but this function provides a neat display of a custom attribute called Author in WooCommerce, Wordpress.
This function relies on the fact that a custom attribute called Author is created. 
It also relies on the fact that a product tag with the same name as the author is created.

Also note that I do not know if the attribute "Author" is used in any other way because of the fact that my Wordpress installation is in Swedish.
I don't think that it matters but what the heck.
I am not the best in PHP documentation but I will probably revise this later.
